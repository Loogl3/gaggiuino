Simulates the extraction style and profile of a Londinium R lever machine. Described as pulling shots that are smooth with great body and an appealing syrupiness. Similar to the previous default profile, for those that are missing it. A flexible style suited for all bean and roast types, with usual consideration given to properly dialing in.
