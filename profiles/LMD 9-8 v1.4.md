Designed for medium to medium-dark beans, the goal is to optimize for even extraction while minimizing the overextraction that can be common with darker beans. This is done by transitioning from a pressure target to a flow target during extraction. 

[SproFiler.io example shot](https://sprofiler.io/shot/9e76af24-b455-408f-a38f-814888102bcd)

**Shot Prep:**  
- standard 20 g basket (not HE)
- 19 g (should work from ~18-20 g; adjust stop-on-weight as needed)

**Main targets:**  
- PI: Flow driven until 2 bar
- Soak: Short soak to not over-extract, transitions after 6 sec or 
- Extraction: Climb to 9 bar over 5 sec, decrease 1 bar over 4 sec, then transition to flow defined profile as the puck grind allows (pressure should ramp down). After 10 seconds, or if pressure drops 3 bar, the flow increases to finish the shot. 
- Weight: 38 g stop-on-weight, 1:2 ratio 

**Notes:**  
- There are some "save the shot" transition parameters defined (e.g. a gram or two in the cup during PI and/or Soak will move the profile on to extraction). If a phase is skipped or short one of those was likely triggered.
- The 9-8 bar results in more crema than desired with some beans; in that case bumping extraction pressure limits down 1 bar can help.
