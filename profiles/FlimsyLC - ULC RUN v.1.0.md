*__This is the RUN profile for Ultra Low Contact, which should be changed to just before the shot is pulled. Have the machine stabilise temperature on the PREP profile first.__*

Flimsy Low Contact (and Ultra Low Contact) are turbo-style profiles that highlight clarity and acidity while minimising astringency and harshness. They achieve this with a combination of low contact time, declining low temperature, and a longer ratio.

Particularly suited to delicate light roasts and highly processed coffees (such as co-ferments), where desirable flavours present in cupping & filter methods often get muddled, drowned out, or overblown in more traditional or higher temperature espresso profiles. General "intensity" can be a little lower than other profiles, so if you find your results taste a little bland, your beans might be suited to different profile such as Zer0, IUIUIU, or Extractamundo Dos. 

These profiles are designed for use with high extraction baskets, or traditional baskets (like a VST) with a bottom filter paper, pulled between a 1:2.5 and 1:3 ratio. You might need a slightly coarser grind than other turbo profiles like extractamundo dos. Aim for appox 13-16s for LC, and 12-15s for ULC, but of course dial in for taste!

The purpose of the separate PREP and RUN profiles are to set an intial higher tempature for the soak, but to let the inflow of water into the boiler cool the brew temperature over the course of the shot. 

LC (Low Contact) is the primary RUN profile, and is little more forgiving than ULC (Ultra Low Contact) with a limit on flow and pressure. ULC pushes the concept a little further, and is worth experimenting with if you have LC dialled in. 

Generally you'll get a more balanced result using both the PREP and RUN profile, however some users on the Gaggiuino Discord have found that skipping the PREP profile and setting RUN to a middle ground temp (72-73c) can produce very juice-forward shots at the trade-off of a further reduction in intensity and traditional espresso flavours. This seems to be suited to particularly easy to extract fruit co-ferments and similar.

Both LC and ULC are based on LongPVO's similary named profiles for the Decent Espresso Machine.
