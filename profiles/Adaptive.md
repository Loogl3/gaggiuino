Designed to adapt to a given grind size by making the extraction phase decide the steady state flow relative to flow at peak pressure, as well as a pressurized bloom stage to maintain puck integrity resulting in a more consistent puck resistance. This allows it to be relatively forgiving to a range of grind settings. Best for light roasts, if using with darker roasts consider reducing temps and a shorter bloom. Use with a ratio between 1:2 and 1:25 with total shot times ranging from 25 to 45
