Used to make filter-style coffee with nothing but your espresso machine, some paper filters and a puck screen. Use a 58mm paper filter (or cut one to size) in the bottom of your portafilter basket, rise with hot water and fill with ground coffee (coarser than typical espresso but much finer than you would usually use for filter). WDT and optional(!) tamp. Place the metal puck screen on top and pull the shot to a 5:1 ratio. Dilute shot with 225-250g of water.
