A very nice overall profile for all kinds of beans and roasts, depending on the roast level you might want to make the second phase longer or shorter, the default works very well for medium and medium-lights.
Aim for a general time around 30-40 seconds depending on roast level, the darker the shorter.

Gotchas:
- For the first phase the goal is to not go above 6bar but it's not necessary for the pressure to hit that target at all, hence the hard stop at 15s
- A ratio of ~1:3 is the target.
