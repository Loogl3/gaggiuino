## Creating a profile:

Some things to know when creating a PR:
- filename.json ( the name of the json file )
- profile.name ( the name used inside the json structure )
- filename.md ( the name of the markdown file )
- strip the **profile ID** when exporting from your system as the ID is system specific and might clash with other people's IDs.

**All the above need to have the same name so the profile is mapped properly to the description, see below image.**
