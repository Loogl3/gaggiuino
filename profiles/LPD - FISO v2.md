Pressure profile designed to mimic a typical La Pavoni lever machine extraction profile, typically characterized by a high 7-9bar pressure during extraction that gives the shots a uniquely thick mouthfeel and intense flavor.

LPD is La Pavoni for dark roasts.
Fast In, Slow Out (FISO) pressure curve to maximize extraction in the early phase of the pull.

19g dose, 2:1 extraction. LPD ratios between 2:1 and 2.5:1 are most viable depending on beans.
